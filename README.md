# Grub Dash Food App React JS Website Styled With Tailwind CSS

## Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies 

### Only the filter type and filter price buttons are live

 All of the data/images to simulate API responses are located at src/data/data.js

This was a fun little project consisting of React & Tailwind which is a super powerful frontend combination you can used to quickly build websites. In this build I focus on adding a little extra javascript with the array filter method to filter out specific food types and pricing categories.
